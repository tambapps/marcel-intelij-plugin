# IntelIJ Plugin for Marcel Lang


This is project is a plugin for IntelIJ, to support [Marcel](https://tambapps.github.io/marcel/).

For now it only supports code highlighting, and nothing else.


I tried to implement parsing but I didn't know what the F I was doing, so I stopped.


This plugin is **not published** anywhere, as it lacks a lot of feature to be truly useful.


## How to build plugin (Note to self)

Run the gradle job `buildPlugin`.
```shell
./gradlew buildPlugin
```
the plugin should be a zip available in `build/distributions/`.
